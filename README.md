## Introduction

The aim of this project is training and running a neural network in order to recognize handwritten digits. This is a very common and introductory task in neural network literature and it can be easily completed using modern languages and systems, but can become a challenge when implemented in a '80s machine.

The core functions (train and predict) are translaetd from https://github.com/dlidstrom/NeuralNetworkInAllLangs C# implementation, while some utility units are inspired from the https://github.com/KarolS/millfork counterpart.
